This site is pretty new at this stage, and we're working on improving things. If you have feedback or found a site we don't have listed, visit our [GitHub page] (https://github.com/adamfowlerit/adamfowlerit.github.io) and let us know there.

Project set up and owned by [Adam Fowler](https://adamfowlerit.com)

Big thanks to those who have contributed:

- [Karl Cooke](https://twitter.com/Karl_ITNerd) has been doing most of the coding and building of this site, and threw himself into making this a lot better than I could have.

- Users at the [WinAdmins Discord](https://aka.ms/winadmins) who've provided feedback and a bunch of extra links; particularly PsychoData, 0x80070005 (Graeme Bray), krbtgt and dec.

- Everyone who shared and commented on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamFowler_IT/status/1321959895839600640) who showed there was value in bothering to do this and again, provided a bunch more links to add.

- All the contributors to this project on GitHub!

- You if you bookmarked or shared this site :)
